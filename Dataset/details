Dataset 1: BraTS 2020 Training & Validation Data
This is the primary source dataset containing multimodal MRI scans of glioblastoma (GBM/HGG) and lower-grade glioma (LGG).
Modalities: 
-- T1: Native T1-weighted
-- T1Gd: Post-contrast T1-weighted (Gadolinium-enhanced)
-- T2: T2-weighted
-- T2-FLAIR: T2 Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery
Segmentation Labels:
- Label 1: Necrotic and non-enhancing tumor core (NCR/NET)
- Label 2: Peritumoral edema (ED)
- Label 4: GD-enhancing tumor (ET)

Dataset 2: brats20logs
This dataset contains the logs and intermediate outputs from the model training process. It is organized into three specific directories:
1. ae (Autoencoders): Contains weights and logs for Autoencoder models, often used for feature extraction or VAE-based regularization.
2. data: Contains data split files (e.g., training/validation lists) and serialized metadata objects.
3. unet: Contains the training history, loss curves, and epoch-wise checkpoints for 3D U-Net architectures.

Dataset 3: BraTS 2020 Competition Data
A secondary mirror of the official BraTS 2020 Competition dataset. It contains the identical NIfTI (.nii.gz) file structure as Dataset 1.

Dataset 4: BraTS Serialized Models & Dataframes
This dataset stores the finalized outputs of the research pipeline. It includes serialized model files and analytical dataframes.
